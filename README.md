# Multi-Scene-Recognition
Multi-scene recognition is a challenging task due to that

+ images are large-scale and unconstrained
+ all present scenes in an aerial image need to be exhaustively recognized

<img src="./figures/illustration.png" width = "50%" height = "50%" alt="example" align=center />

In this work, we propose a large-scale dataset, namely MultiScene dataset, and provide extensive benchmarks.
