# Multi-Scene-Recognition

MultiScene dataset aims at two tasks: 1) developing algorithms for multi-scene recognition and 2) network learning with noisy labels.

We collect 100k high-resolution aerial images with the size of 256x256. All of them are assigned with crowdsourced labels provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM), and 14k of them are mannually inspected yielding clean labels.
