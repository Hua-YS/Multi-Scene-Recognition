# Multi-Scene-Recognition \[[webpage]()\]\[[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02846.pdf)\]
MultiScene dataset aims at two tasks: 1) developing algorithms for multi-scene recognition and 2) network learning with noisy labels.

We collect 100k high-resolution aerial images with the size of 512x512. All of them are assigned with crowdsourced labels provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM), and 14k of them are mannually inspected yielding clean labels. In total, 36 scene categories are defined in our dataset, and 22 models are tested for providing a benchmark.
