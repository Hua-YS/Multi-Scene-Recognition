# Multi-Scene-Recognition




[MultiScene dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02846.pdf) aims at two tasks: 1) developing algorithms for multi-scene recognition and 2) network learning with noisy labels.

We collect 100k high-resolution aerial images with the size of 256x256. All of them are assigned with crowdsourced labels provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM), and 14k of them are mannually inspected yielding clean labels. In total, 22 models are tested on our dataset.
